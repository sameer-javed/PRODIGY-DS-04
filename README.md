# üéâ Fourth Internship Milestone: Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data üìä

Exciting milestone! I‚Äôve successfully completed my **4th internship task** as a **Data Scientist Intern** at **Prodigy InfoTech**! üôå

## Task Overview
**Task**: Conduct **Sentiment Analysis** on Twitter tweets data to classify tweets as **racist/sexist** or **not** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. ü§ñ

### Objective:
The primary objective of this project was to develop a model that can accurately identify and classify tweets based on their content, helping to address issues of racism and sexism in online communications.

## My Approach:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the Twitter data to prepare it for analysis.
   - Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and performed text normalization (e.g., tokenization, lowercasing).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conducted EDA to gain insights into the data distribution and identify patterns.
   - Analyzed the frequency of racist/sexist content and visualized key statistics.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Implemented a **Train-Test Split** to evaluate the model's performance.
   - Used the **Logistic Regression** algorithm to train the model on the processed data.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Accurately predicted whether tweets were sexist/racist or not based on the trained model.

## Skills Honed:
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Developed techniques to analyze and interpret human language data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Enhanced skills in cleaning and preparing text data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Gained experience in exploring data distributions and deriving insights.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Learned to effectively train and evaluate machine learning models.
- **Logistic Regression**: Gained proficiency in applying the Logistic Regression algorithm for classification tasks.

## Tools and Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Core programming language for implementation.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for model training and evaluation.
- **NLTK / SpaCy**: Libraries utilized for Natural Language Processing tasks.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizing EDA results and model performance metrics.

## Acknowledgments
Thanks to **Prodigy InfoTech** for the opportunity to work on this challenging project! üôè I look forward to applying these skills to future endeavors in the field of data science.
